# Jams

These are the regular contact improvisation jams in Vienna. (The not-so-regular ones are listed at the bottom of the page.)\
Please double-check the [calendar](/calendar) and the external pages before going to the jam!  

As different jams have different atmospheres, we suggest to give all of them a try to find out what fits best to your needs and expectations. If you are new to Contact Improvisation, please refer to the 'for beginners'-section.
